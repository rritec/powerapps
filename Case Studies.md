Case Study: Replacing an error-prone email and Excel business process with Power Apps
A staff member in one of the banks in Nigeria noticed that there was an extremely manual process for handling daily cash transactions between the central office, branches, and ATM machines. There were numerous spreadsheets that were manually consolidated all update the main records. This person created a PowerApp to handle all of this. Now employees could use the app with a single data store connector that managed the main file. The information store replaced the 100+ transaction spreadsheets, reduced errors, increased efficiency, and improved morale.

She was so excited about the success she had helped build, that she started Citizen Devs Academy to help train others in her bank. 100+ people graduated. This was so well received that she started a user group to teach all people in Nigeria. Their user group is over 1500 people. That is 1500 people now making apps to help address and solve problems in their jobs, homes, and cities.
