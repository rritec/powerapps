# Create account
1. To use PowerApps, you will need either a work or school account. But what if you don't have any of these? No need to worry - we have a solution! By joining the Microsoft 365 Developer program, you will be able to create and manage a full Microsoft 365 administrator account where you'll have access to core Microsoft 365 apps such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook/Exchange, Teams, Planner, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.
2. Once you have this account, you will then be able to sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan which will grant you access to Power Apps.
